# basic-hotel:
Continue self-taught, create landing page for hotel website. (Project Build).
The projec will be ref. to as the basic-hotel, we are building this project just to confirm knowledge on the basics for both html and css skills. 

## Description:
This project will be created to be a mock-up for a hotel landing page. This page will only be created using basic html elements and basic css selectors and properties. This is to confirm the understanding with the use of semantic html and the use of proper naming when creating the ids and classes selector for the stylesheet. During the project build I will perform a step-by-step follow along guide of what I am creating and what has been created within that section or save point. 

## Breakdown:

1. Start with creating the readme file and documenting the description for the project build.
2. Create the html file for the project build. Set up the html file, boilerplate.
3. Create the folder to hold all the assets for the project build.

5. Create the images folder within the assets folder to hold all the images for the project.
6. Create the stylesheet/ css file within the css folder.
7. Create the link tag, from the stylesheet in the css folder to the html file/ project.
8. Save and commit. The project folder should be set up to begin the build.
