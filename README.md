# basic-hotel:
Continue self-taught, create landing page for hotel website. (Project Build).
The projec will be ref. to as the basic-hotel, we are building this project just to confirm knowledge on the basics for both html and css skills. 

## Description:
This project will be created to be a mock-up for a hotel landing page. This page will only be created using basic html elements and basic css selectors and properties. This is to confirm the understanding with the use of semantic html and the use of proper naming when creating the ids and classes selector for the stylesheet. During the project build I will perform a step-by-step follow along guide of what I am creating and what has been created within that section or save point.
